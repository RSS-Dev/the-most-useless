# The Most Useless Website

This is probably the most useless website in the observable universe. It's purpose, other than nothing,
is to be an example of a site built with Rails, and to be a place for people learning to program to put their ideas.

## Getting Started

* Clone or fork this repo
* Make sure you have Ruby 2.2.2+, as well as Node.JS, installed
* Install the gems
```
bundle install
```

* Install the dependencies from npm
```
npm install
```

* Start the server
```
rails s
```

* Then run gulp to build assets
```
gulp
```

## Features
This website is for you to contribute your own ideas, and to learn by doing.

Right now, it features:

* Authentication
* Asset Compilation with Gulp

## Contributing
If you have an idea, then you can either fork this repo, add it yourself, and then create a pull request, or create an issue. Then, somebody else might implement that for you.
